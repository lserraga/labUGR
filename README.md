# LabUGR
Compilation of functions for signal analysis in python.

## Abstract
The aim of this project is to build an open source Python library using Matplotlib and NumPy as a base and compiling functions from various other modules to create a compact environment which includes all the necessary functions for signal processing and visualization.The aim of this library is to provide a smooth introduction to python for first and second year students of the university of Granada, Spain through the  following classes: 'Sistemas Lineales' - 'Linear Systems' and 'Se√±ales digitals' - 'Digital Signals'.

## Requirements
Python 3.4, 3.5 or 3.6 and pip. 

This library can be easilly installed with a single command in Windows 32/64, many Linux distributions 32/64 and Mac OS.
__`pip install labugr`__


## 
The library has been compiled for Windows 32 bits and 64 bits, Mac OS and Linux 32/64 bits. This last one using the docker images from the manylinux project. The compiled wheels are hosted at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/labugr/1.1 and contain the following external dependencies: fortran, C an C++ compilers; LAPACK/BLAS subroutines (from the ATLAS distribution).

    Extract a diagonal or construct a diagonal array.

    See the more detailed documentation for ``numpy.diagonal`` if you use this
    function to extract a diagonal and wish to write to the resulting array;
    whether it returns a copy or a view depends on what version of numpy you
    are using.

    Parameters
    ----------
    v : array_like
        If `v` is a 2-D array, return a copy of its `k`-th diagonal.
        If `v` is a 1-D array, return a 2-D array with `v` on the `k`-th
        diagonal.
    k : int, optional
        Diagonal in question. The default is 0. Use `k>0` for diagonals
        above the main diagonal, and `k<0` for diagonals below the main
        diagonal.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The extracted diagonal or constructed diagonal array.

    See Also
    --------
    diagonal : Return specified diagonals.
    diagflat : Create a 2-D array with the flattened input as a diagonal.
    trace : Sum along diagonals.
    triu : Upper triangle of an array.
    tril : Lower triangle of an array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(9).reshape((3,3))
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8]])

    >>> np.diag(x)
    array([0, 4, 8])
    >>> np.diag(x, k=1)
    array([1, 5])
    >>> np.diag(x, k=-1)
    array([3, 7])

    >>> np.diag(np.diag(x))
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [0, 0, 8]])

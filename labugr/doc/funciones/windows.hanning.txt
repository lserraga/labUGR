    Return a Hann window.

    The Hann window is a taper formed by using a raised cosine or sine-squared
    with ends that touch zero.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : int
        Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an empty
        array is returned.
    sym : bool, optional
        When True (default), generates a symmetric window, for use in filter
        design.
        When False, generates a periodic window, for use in spectral analysis.

    Returns
    -------
    w : ndarray
        The window, with the maximum value normalized to 1 (though the value 1
        does not appear if `M` is even and `sym` is True).

    Notes
    -----
    The Hann window is defined as

    .. math::  w(n) = 0.5 - 0.5 \cos\left(\frac{2\pi{n}}{M-1}\right)
               \qquad 0 \leq n \leq M-1

    The window was named for Julius von Hann, an Austrian meteorologist. It is
    also known as the Cosine Bell. It is sometimes erroneously referred to as
    the "Hanning" window, from the use of "hann" as a verb in the original
    paper and confusion with the very similar Hamming window.

    Most references to the Hann window come from the signal processing
    literature, where it is used as one of many windowing functions for
    smoothing values.  It is also known as an apodization (which means
    "removing the foot", i.e. smoothing discontinuities at the beginning
    and end of the sampled signal) or tapering function.

    Examples
    --------
    Plot the window and its frequency response:

    >>> from scipy import signal
    >>> from scipy.fftpack import fft, fftshift
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    >>> window = signal.hann(51)
    >>> plt.plot(window)
    >>> plt.title("Hann window")
    >>> plt.ylabel("Amplitude")
    >>> plt.xlabel("Sample")

    >>> plt.figure()
    >>> A = fft(window, 2048) / (len(window)/2.0)
    >>> freq = np.linspace(-0.5, 0.5, len(A))
    >>> response = 20 * np.log10(np.abs(fftshift(A / abs(A).max())))
    >>> plt.plot(freq, response)
    >>> plt.axis([-0.5, 0.5, -120, 0])
    >>> plt.title("Frequency response of the Hann window")
    >>> plt.ylabel("Normalized magnitude [dB]")
    >>> plt.xlabel("Normalized frequency [cycles per sample]")

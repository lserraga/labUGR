    Get or set the *x* limits of the current axes.

    ::

      xmin, xmax = xlim()   # return the current xlim
      xlim( (xmin, xmax) )  # set the xlim to xmin, xmax
      xlim( xmin, xmax )    # set the xlim to xmin, xmax

    If you do not specify args, you can pass the xmin and xmax as
    kwargs, e.g.::

      xlim(xmax=3) # adjust the max leaving min unchanged
      xlim(xmin=1) # adjust the min leaving max unchanged

    Setting limits turns autoscaling off for the x-axis.

    The new axis limits are returned as a length 2 tuple.

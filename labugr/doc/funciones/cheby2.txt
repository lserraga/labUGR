    Chebyshev type II digital and analog filter design.

    Design an Nth-order digital or analog Chebyshev type II filter and
    return the filter coefficients.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
        The order of the filter.
    rs : float
        The minimum attenuation required in the stop band.
        Specified in decibels, as a positive number.
    Wn : array_like
        A scalar or length-2 sequence giving the critical frequencies.
        For Type II filters, this is the point in the transition band at which
        the gain first reaches -`rs`.
        For digital filters, `Wn` is normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 is the
        Nyquist frequency, pi radians/sample.  (`Wn` is thus in
        half-cycles / sample.)
        For analog filters, `Wn` is an angular frequency (e.g. rad/s).
    btype : {'lowpass', 'highpass', 'bandpass', 'bandstop'}, optional
        The type of filter.  Default is 'lowpass'.
    analog : bool, optional
        When True, return an analog filter, otherwise a digital filter is
        returned.
    output : {'ba', 'zpk', 'sos'}, optional
        Type of output:  numerator/denominator ('ba'), pole-zero ('zpk'), or
        second-order sections ('sos'). Default is 'ba'.

    Returns
    -------
    b, a : ndarray, ndarray
        Numerator (`b`) and denominator (`a`) polynomials of the IIR filter.
        Only returned if ``output='ba'``.
    z, p, k : ndarray, ndarray, float
        Zeros, poles, and system gain of the IIR filter transfer
        function.  Only returned if ``output='zpk'``.
    sos : ndarray
        Second-order sections representation of the IIR filter.
        Only returned if ``output=='sos'``.

    Notes
    -----
    The Chebyshev type II filter maximizes the rate of cutoff between the
    frequency response's passband and stopband, at the expense of ripple in
    the stopband and increased ringing in the step response.

    Type II filters do not roll off as fast as Type I (`cheby1`).

    The ``'sos'`` output parameter was added in 0.16.0.

    Examples
    --------
    Plot the filter's frequency response, showing the critical points:

    >>> from scipy import signal
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    >>> b, a = signal.cheby2(4, 40, 100, 'low', analog=True)
    >>> w, h = signal.freqs(b, a)
    >>> plt.semilogx(w, 20 * np.log10(abs(h)))
    >>> plt.title('Chebyshev Type II frequency response (rs=40)')
    >>> plt.xlabel('Frequency [radians / second]')
    >>> plt.ylabel('Amplitude [dB]')
    >>> plt.margins(0, 0.1)
    >>> plt.grid(which='both', axis='both')
    >>> plt.axvline(100, color='green') # cutoff frequency
    >>> plt.axhline(-40, color='green') # rs
    >>> plt.show()
